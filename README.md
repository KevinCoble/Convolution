# Convolution
A Mac GUI for the deep-network convolution routines in AIToolbox

This is an interface to attempt to learn classification labels for images using the DeepNetwork class that will shortly be added to the AIToolbox framework

I will add some instructions on how to use it here over the next few days

Still a few missing options, but it learns the first batch - recognizing horizontal line images!
